Fall here in Houston has not yet began. But thank god at least we had few days
70s. Well, to make my outfit practical enough to roam around the town. I made
few fall(ish) combinations from my summer wardrobe.

Also, if you guys donâ€™t have any of these and are planning to buy them, I feel
its perfect time to pull that trigger because most of summer collection is on
discount and brands keep on adding additional discounts too. (so, yay!!)

-   Pleated skirt from express

    This pleated skirt from express is excellent to dress up or down. You can
    either pair it with sweater or full sleeves rib t-shirt. For work, you can
    also dress it up with animal print or block color cami and blazer.

-   Next is my favorite skirt, this silk skirt is from ExpressxRocky Barnes
    collection. This skirt gives so stylist vibes, you can pair it will bright
    color sweater to achieve perfect mix pattern combo. You can also pair with
    t-shirt and any leather jacket or woolen coat.

-   All t-shirt dress could be perfect for fall style with leather jackets or
    woolen cardigan

-   Mini skirt with graphic tee or top and blazer is a deadly combo. You can
    wear any combat boots or sneakers. We believe me you will never go wrong
    with this.
