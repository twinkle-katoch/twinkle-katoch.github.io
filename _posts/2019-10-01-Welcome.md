Hello and welcome everyone!!

I have been in love with fashion and style since my childhood. It all started
from wearing my mom’s makeup to her sarees. In school and university styling
myself and friends was fun. Now that I am going to write about it, super excites
me!!

Styling, dressing-up, sketching dresses shoes all are like meditation to me. So,
by doing this I am also giving myself new opportunity to flourish in something I
have always been so much into but never shared. I can’t thank my hubby Hardik
enough for encouraging me to publish my content. Also 29-year-old in me tells me
to be more expressive and bolder.
