Well this season I have enjoyed mixing textures in every way possible. I feel
lucky to be living around Houston where wintertime is ‘sweater weather’. I have
listed few outfit ideas that I think you will enjoy trying out. Let know what
you guys think.

I can’t get enough of this skirt from express. I bought this is summer and
wearing it through out fall/winter. Well that money was well spent. Fun thing
about animal print is that it can be treated as neutral.

I styled this skirt with bright color sweater. If you are not fond of block
colors, you can style it with black/white sweater or sweatshirt and you can
never go wrong. Here are few pictures of how I wore this skirt. Sadly this skirt
is out of stock but I have linked few similars options
[here](https://rstyle.me/+GxQn_fDQ0MPup6zCdNLKLA),
[here](https://rstyle.me/+Et3i8f1Y5HOHDdJYDA6LnA) and here.

When it comes to Tulle skirt, its always tricky to style. And honestly, I never
owned a Tulle skirt before, not because I didn’t wanted to but I couldn’t find
the right fit and right amount of flare I needed. But my search ended here. I
have styled this skirt in 3 different ways.

First I styled it with this beautiful [Cardigan sweater](https://rstyle.me/+WU2rxNeLaqCWN-0OSS1Eqw) from H&M again. I love
the details on buttons. You can easily style it with jeans or pants.

<div class="moneyspot-widget" data-widget-id="36033085"><script type="text/javascript">!function(w,i,d,g,e,t){d.getElementById(i)||(element=d.createElement(t),element.id=i,element.src="https://widgets.rewardstyle.com"+e,d.body.appendChild(element)),w.hasOwnProperty(g)===!0&&"complete"===d.readyState&&w[g].init()}(window,"moneyspot-script",document,"__moneyspot","/js/widget.js","script")</script><div class="rs-adblock"><img src="https://assets.rewardstyle.com/production/e63b97d11f30fc7605928f359e70564d356ddcac/images/search/350.gif" onerror='this.parentNode.innerHTML="Disable your ad blocking software to view this content."' style="width: 15px; height: 15px"><noscript>JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

Skirt goes well with leather top or jacket. I love how leather and the dot
patterns go. You can also style this with sneakers. I have wore it with Jimmy
choo sneakers, sadly these are sold out but linked few options
[here](https://rstyle.me/+1FK3FsjIbVFsUOW52T5zAg),
[here](https://rstyle.me/+Q9Ebvh2ZoWfobHAbwHK1Ow).

<div class="moneyspot-widget" data-widget-id="36033310"><script type="text/javascript">!function(w,i,d,g,e,t){d.getElementById(i)||(element=d.createElement(t),element.id=i,element.src="https://widgets.rewardstyle.com"+e,d.body.appendChild(element)),w.hasOwnProperty(g)===!0&&"complete"===d.readyState&&w[g].init()}(window,"moneyspot-script",document,"__moneyspot","/js/widget.js","script")</script><div class="rs-adblock"><img src="https://assets.rewardstyle.com/production/5e5680500d8ed849e166f8f3ff5041ac0583d458/images/search/350.gif" onerror='this.parentNode.innerHTML="Disable your ad blocking software to view this content."' style="width: 15px; height: 15px"><noscript>JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

Leather boots and flare skirt always a good idea. Bold and elegant. My croc
effect boots are from mango. Check out my blog post on croc effect boots.
