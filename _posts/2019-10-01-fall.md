So finally boot season is upon us. Fall fashion is my favorite. You can play
around with layers and boots; it can never be too much or too less. Since we are
in October already, I am sharing my fall collection so far and my Wishlist.

Well speaking of trends, animal print and plaid prints have taken over the
season. And honestly, I am so obsessed with them. I can’t also get enough of
neutrals. Neutral and warm colors too are so in fashion(Although I am planning
to write different blog post about it). I thought I would get something from
each palette. Sharing my “Something list” here. Hope you guys enjoy it.

-   Something plaid

    -   This cute skirt is from
        [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/mad-for-plaid-beige-plaid-mini-skirt/512072.html)
        and yes it gives me Racheal Green vibes. I also signed up for email to
        get 15% off.

-   This skirt is so elegant and trendy from
    [Target](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-relaxed-fit-high-rise-midi-skirt-a-new-day-153-gray/-/A-54493746?preselect=54482316#lnk=sametab).
    I have been wearing this to work and is so comfortable.

-   Something with animal print

    -   My favorite from the list is this animal print mini dress from something
        navy.

    sight.

-   Something to layer

    -   This [H&M coat](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0786743003.html)
        is in my Wishlist. Since I live and in Houston I don’t have to worry
        about layering until end of October

-   How cool is this layer from Francescas.

-   Something faux/vegan leather

    -   H&M’s faux leather skirt is everything, especially for the price it’s
        decent purchase. I throw it up with sweater or graphic tee

![](media/16266c52fb759f7a7b95b96ccf5ff8ac.jpg)

-   This [Zara
    jacket](https://www.zara.com/us/en/faux-leather-jacket-p03046242.html?v1=30865251&v2=1281521)
    was my go-to during my current stay in Chicago. Since I have petite and
    curvy body type not all have perfect length and sizing. This one is perfect
    for me.

PS: Most of my clothing are in affordable section since I gain and loss weight.
My wardrobe has sizes from 4 to 10, so I usually go easy in clothing section.
