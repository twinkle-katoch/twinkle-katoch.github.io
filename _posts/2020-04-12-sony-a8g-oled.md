After a lot of tug of war on wether or not to spend $2000+ on a 4k tv, we finally decided to upgrade our current 39" FHD LCD. Sure old TV worked great, but we are talking about a huge upgrade with 4k OLED panel!

## 65" Sony A8G OLED TV 

What is OLED anyways?!

 - Infinite contrast ratio
 - Life like (no kidding!) picture reproduction with true colors
 - Slim build
 - Incredible viewing angles
 - Millions self illuminating pixels

Period.
 
That is how I can describe this screen at minimal. OLED is latest in screen panels with individually lighted pixels, as you may know, unlike most LCD/QLED panels which use separate source of light. This aspect gives OLED technology cutting edge by controlling screen picture at pixel level instead of screen zones. Blacks on screen are simply completely turned of pixels.

Because each pixel's color and brightness can be controlled individually, pictures produced by OLED panel are exceptionally life like, unlike LCD/LED (LED tv is really LCD tv with LED being used as backlight). With Quantum dot technology, LCD (or QLED precisely) came far with producing better colors. And for better contrast full array backlight helped somewhat. But in my opinion, OLED has no match.

## Downs of OLED

You just cannot get it all! :( 
	
- OLED are inglorious for so called "burn in" or ghost image.
 
	In simpler terms, some pixels are burned and cannot anymore produce full brightness or correct colors. Leaving picture inaccurate or sometimes clearly intolerably annoying. Though manufacturers claim it's thing of past, one always have to be careful. Though each year OLED tech is becoming more better. There are solutions implemented in latest panels through hardware and software.

- Limited options

	Samsung is against OLED TVs, though they use OLED on their (mostly) every phone. At the moment only Sony and LG are only leading brands producing OLED TVs. Only LG produces OLED panels, and hence only 55" and 65" sizes available.

- Expensive!!

	Unless you consider $2k cheap. :) But, rest assured you get what you pay for. You get a premium set of television with premium feat

## Quick comparison for buying

| Price          | Vast range                          | Mid range to Pricy | Pricy          |

After much swing between QLED and OLED (due to budget!!) we jumped our guns on OLED (thank God!). We shortlisted 65" LG C9 and Sony A8G. Both great OLED TVs with C9 a winner on paper in terms of tech available for buck. Though LG had all bells and whistle, we loved color calibration and out of box sound of faithful Sony better. I had past personal bad experience with LG, hence we ended up buying Sony A8G.

Enjoying this pricy piece of tech for almost 6 months now, and so far it has never let me down. 4k@60 FPS gaming is also amazing.
