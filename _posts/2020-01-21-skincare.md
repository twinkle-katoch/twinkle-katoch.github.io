I am not someone who is crazy about makeup or wear makeup daily. I never try to
hide my breakouts or acnes or darkspots. But I do believe in healthy skin and
supplements that skin needs. My hunt for good cosmetic brand that suits me ended
with Caudalie. I have been using Caudalie products for over a year now and I
have been obsessed with them.

I have tried many Caudalie serums, creams and masks everything worked out great
for me and so I decided to write post about it. Lats year I walked in Sephora,
looking for some clean brands. One beautiful sales lady introduced me to this
brand Caudalie. Since then I have been in love with it. Caudalie use Grape
extracts in all products and that is what convinced me to try them out.

I have skin with uneven texture and darkspots. Since I started using Caudalie
products in my night routine things changed for me. I saw visible difference
within 2 weeks. Here is the list products I use.

Step 1

Ofc I start with face wash with [Instant foaming
Cleanser](https://rstyle.me/+dfuiBxgUMxSw4oeKatlwPg). This face wash is so
gentle on my skin, even breakout donâ€™t hurt.

Step 2

Next I use this [Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic
Essence](https://rstyle.me/+MzZqUBDytOvJgdCRfT9GLQ) . It helps exfoliates dead
cells. Initially I was using it everyday now only alternate days.

Step 3

Next, I apply [Vinoperfect Anti-Dark Spot
Serum](https://rstyle.me/+0UOUPkgKR0a3WmDrc3MHvQ), this really helped to even
out my texture.

Step 4

My final step is to [night cream](https://rstyle.me/+LtspG57oS5HMeTABzEX0SA).
Every morning my skin feels to soft and buttery. Sometimes when I feels too
lazy, I simply wash my face and just apply night cream.
